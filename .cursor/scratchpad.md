# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to update the project's attribution to more accurately reflect its origins. The current project states it is "inspired by" `SmartHypercube/ustclife`, but the user has indicated it should be attributed as a "fork" and wants to add more detailed credit to the original creators and specify the license of the original source code. This applies to both the website footer in `index.html` and the project's `README.md`.

The user has received a message from the original creator of `SmartHypercube/ustclife` requesting proper attribution under the `CC BY-SA 4.0` license. The user has manually updated the `index.html` file and is asking for confirmation on whether the new attribution follows best practices.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1.  **Clarifying User Intent**: The user provided an HTML snippet with placeholders (`https://ut01.......`, `xxx`) and a fixed year (`2025`). The exact format and content need to be finalized. It's unclear if the new text should replace the existing copyright line or be added alongside it.
2.  **License Discrepancy**: The user's provided text mentions the original work is licensed under `CC BY-SA 4.0`. The current `README.md` for this project mentions `MIT`. The `LICENSE` file in the repository appears to be the `ANTI-996 LICENSE`. This needs investigation to ensure correct licensing information is displayed for both the original project and this fork.
3.  **Markdown Conversion**: The HTML snippet for `index.html` needs to be adapted to Markdown for the `README.md` file.
4.  **Verifying Compliance**: The main challenge is to verify that the user's manual changes, along with the previous changes, fully satisfy the `CC BY-SA 4.0` license requirements, specifically the "Attribution" (BY) and "ShareAlike" (SA) clauses. The project appears to be fully compliant.

## High-level Task Breakdown

1.  **Research Original Project**: Investigate the `SmartHypercube/ustclife` GitHub repository to find its license, and how it handles attribution in its own footer.
2.  **Formulate `index.html` Change**: Propose a specific change to the footer in `index.html`.
3.  **Formulate `README.md` Change**: Propose a specific change to the `README.md` file.
4.  **Present Plan to User**: Show the proposed changes to the user for approval.
5.  **Execute Changes**: Apply the approved changes to `index.html` and `README.md`.
6.  **Confirm Compliance**: Analyze the final state of the project against the original author's request and `CC BY-SA 4.0` license terms.
7.  **Draft GitHub Reply**: Formulate a response in Chinese to the original creator.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

All tasks are complete. A reply has been drafted for the user to post on GitHub. No further action is needed for this task.

## Lessons

-   Confirmed the project's license is `CC BY-SA 4.0` as per the `LICENSE` file, not `MIT` as previously stated in `README.md`. It's important to verify license information from the actual license file.
-   When dealing with forked projects, it's crucial to respect the original author's license. If the license changes, the fork must be updated to comply.
-   A good attribution notice should be clear, provide credit to the author, and link to both the original work and the license. The user's final version in `index.html` is a great example of this.
-   An archived repository is read-only and cannot be updated. Compliance efforts should focus on the active repository. Deleting an intermediate fork in a chain does not re-parent the child fork and can obscure project history.

# Task 3: Cleanup Temporary Sync Branches

## Background and Motivation

Multiple temporary branches were created to facilitate upstream synchronization. We should remove unused ones to keep both local and remote tidy.

## Proposed Cleanup (Safe)

Keep until PR is merged:
- upstream: `sync/replace-on-upstream` (PR branch)

Delete now (remote upstream):
- `sync/upstream-merge`
- `sync/clean-no-merge`
- `sync/snapshot-from-ut01`

Delete locally (after switching off them):
- `git branch -D sync/upstream-merge`
- `git branch -D sync/clean-no-merge`
- `git branch -D sync/snapshot-from-ut01`

Delete on upstream (remote):
- `git push upstream :refs/heads/sync/upstream-merge`
- `git push upstream :refs/heads/sync/clean-no-merge`
- `git push upstream :refs/heads/sync/snapshot-from-ut01`

After PR is merged, optionally delete:
- local: `git branch -D sync/replace-on-upstream`
- remote: `git push upstream :refs/heads/sync/replace-on-upstream`

Housekeeping:
- `git fetch upstream --prune`
- If desired, restore local workspace: `git checkout main && git stash pop`

## Project Status Board (Task 3)
- [x] Approve cleanup list
- [x] Delete remote temp branches (`sync/upstream-merge`, `sync/clean-no-merge`, `sync/snapshot-from-ut01`)
- [x] Delete local temp branches
- [x] Post-merge: delete PR branch (`sync/replace-on-upstream`) after PR is merged

## Executor's Feedback (Task 3)
- Switched to `main` and deleted local branches: `sync/upstream-merge`, `sync/clean-no-merge`, `sync/snapshot-from-ut01`, `sync/replace-on-upstream`.
- Deleted remote branch on `upstream`: `sync/replace-on-upstream`; pruned refs.
- Stash pending: `stash@{0}` (message: "pre-sync workspace"). Applying it now would overwrite current `.cursor/scratchpad.md`. Please confirm whether to drop the stash or apply it while keeping current scratchpad.
